# üí´ About Me:
### üëã Elevator Pitch  
Hi, I‚Äôm Daniel, a Junior at CUNY City College majoring in Computer Science and a passionate software engineer focused on building next-generation AI products. I thrive at the intersection of data, AI, and software engineering, creating AI-driven solutions to tackle real-world challenges.

### üöÄ Incoming GDG Campus Lead  
This semester, I'm excited to step into the role of Google Developer Group (GDG) Campus Lead at The City College of New York. I‚Äôll be working to bring more tech events, workshops, and networking opportunities to the CCNY campus, fostering a vibrant tech community for students interested in Google technologies and beyond.

### üèÜ Hackathon Champion  
Hackathons are my playground. I‚Äôve participated in 17 (and counting!), with my most recent win at the CUNY Tech Prep C10 Hackathon, where my team and I won the "Essential Needs Imagineering Award" for our project CUNY Guide. This AI-powered Q&A chatbot, built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GPT-4o-mini, helps students access essential resources like mental health support, food security, and housing.

### ü§ù Previous Leadership Experience  
Last spring, I had the honor of serving as President of Beavers Code, the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) chapter at The City College of New York. Leading a community of 300+ members, 20+ volunteers, and organizing 8 successful workshops, we fostered an inclusive environment for aspiring tech professionals. We also collaborated with organizations like Girls Who Code, Society of Women Engineers, IEEE, and Women in Computer Science, making a lasting impact on the student community.

### üìÖ What‚Äôs Next?  
I‚Äôm gearing up for hackathons such as HackHarvard, HackPrinceton, HackRU, and YHack, where I‚Äôll be teaming up with innovative minds to take on exciting challenges and solve meaningful real-world problems. On top of that, I‚Äôm expanding my skill set through CodePath Web103, where I‚Äôll be refining my web development capabilities, and CodePath TIP103, focusing on technical interview prep. I‚Äôm also immersed in the CUNY Tech Prep Data Science program, diving deep into data-driven projects and machine learning solutions.

### üèì Beyond the Code  
When I‚Äôm not coding or at hackathons, you‚Äôll find me on the pickleball court. Let‚Äôs talk about Generative AI, Leetcode, or Hackathons! Feel free to connect!
